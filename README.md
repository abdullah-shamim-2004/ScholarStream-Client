## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Stripe Account (for payment testing)
- Firebase Project (for authentication)

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repositories
```bash
# Client
git clone https://github.com/abdullah-shamim-2004/ScholarStream-Client.git


# Server
git clone https://github.com/abdullah-shamim-2004/ScholarStream-Server.git

```

#### 2. Set up environment variables

**Client `.env`** (create in root of client folder)
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
```

**Server `.env`** (create in root of server folder)
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
STRIPE_SECRET=your_stripe_secret_key
VITE_CLIENT_UR=http://localhost:5173
FB_SERVICE_KEY=your_firebase_secret_key
```

> **Note:** See `.env.example` files in both repos for complete variable lists.

#### 3. Run the application

**Server** (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd scholar-stream-server
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Client** (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd scholar-stream-client
npm run dev
# Client runs on http://localhost:5173
```

#### 4. Test with sample data
- Default admin credentials are in `server/config/seedData.js` (or create your own admin from Firebase Console)
- Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future date, any CVC

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Both client and server require environment variables. **Never commit `.env` files.**

**Files you need to create:**
- `client/.env` (see `client/.env.example`)
- `server/.env` (see `server/.env.example`)

**Required keys:**
- Firebase config (from Firebase Console)
- MongoDB URI (from MongoDB Atlas or local)
- Stripe keys (from Stripe Dashboard)
- JWT secret (generate a random secure string)

## 🎯 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Payment Retry Logic
**Problem:** Users losing application data on payment failure  
**Solution:** Implemented automatic draft saving before Stripe redirect, allowing users to retry payment from their application dashboard

### Challenge 2: Role-Based UI Rendering
**Problem:** Complexity managing different UI states for 3 user roles  
**Solution:** Created custom React hooks (`useRole`, `useAuth`) with context API for centralized role checking

### Challenge 3: Real-time Application Status
**Problem:** Users not seeing updated application status after admin actions  
**Solution:** Integrated TanStack Query with aggressive cache invalidation and optimistic updates
